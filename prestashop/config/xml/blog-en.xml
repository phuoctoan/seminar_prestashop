			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you have an online store with great products, now what? The success of your business depends on bringing in customers. But how can you attract those customers without cash flow and brand recognition? Growth hacking.</p>
<p>Simply put, growth hacking tactics are an inexpensive and innovative alternative to traditional marketing. And it’s how you can build awareness and reduce your customer acquisition costs to nearly $0.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18839" title="main" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/main-1024x537.png" alt="" width="584" height="306" /></p>
<p><span id="more-18763"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #65c6bb;">Introduction</span></h4>
<p>Growth hacking has undoubtedly been the driving force behind some of the most successful startups. Companies such as Air B&amp;B, YouTube, Dropbox and Groupon are all early adopters of <a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/ultimate-startup-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank">growth hacking strategies</a>. Clearly, it’s working.</p>
<p>Now, how can you do it too? Let’s review 3 simple growth hacks that ecommerce sites use to grow their customer base. Through social media, search engine, rich content and viral marketing, you’ll be able to squeeze more out of the time and effort spent acquiring new customers.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #2574a9;">Customer Refer Customer</span></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #65c6bb;">“Refer a friend and get $25 towards your next purchase!”</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18832" title="Customer Refer Customer" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/Customer-Refer-Customer.png" alt="" width="575" height="319" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #2574a9;"><strong>Why it works:</strong></span> Refer a friend programs develop a sense of reciprocity between you and your customer. Since generally refer a friend programs require that the referral makes a purchase/subscribes, a customer feels obliged to refer a qualified lead to guarantee they will be rewarded.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2574a9;"><strong>What to test:</strong></span> Try different incentives and offer them at different stages of the customer’s lifecycle to find out what works best. Here are few examples of referral incentives:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• “Refer 3 friends and get a free gift package”<br />
• “Invite 5 friends and get 3 months of free shipping”<br />
• “Invite friends and earn 300 loyalty points!”<br />
• “Refer a friend and get 1 month free subscription”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #2574a9;">Connect with Influencers</span></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #65c6bb;">Engage online influencers that are key players in your niche</span></h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18833" title="Influencer Image" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/Influencer-Image1.png" alt="" width="575" height="400" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #2574a9;">Why it works:</span></strong> Building relationships and incentivizing influencers such as bloggers, journalists, experts to give you coverage introduces your online business to their entire audience. If you picked the <a href="http://www.socialmediaelearning.co.uk/social-media-influencers-find-engage-grow-your-business/" target="_blank">right influencers</a> then you just opened the doors to an exponential number of potential customers. This strategy also creates back links to your website, augmenting your SEO efforts.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #2574a9;">Where to start:</span></strong> Start small. Convincing a major influencer to give you coverage doesn’t happen over night. Begin by reaching out to non-celebrity bloggers that have a strong social media presence then work your way to the top!</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #2574a9;">Social Prospecting</span></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #65c6bb;">Engage potential customers via digital guerilla marketing</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18834" title="EN_Social Prospecting" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/EN_Social-Prospecting.png" alt="" width="470" height="241" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18835" title="EN_SocialProspecting2" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/EN_SocialProspecting2.png" alt="" width="470" height="267" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #2574a9;"><strong>Why it works:</strong></span> You’re connecting with social media users that are speaking out about your specific industry, product or niche market. This means they are already interested! By providing personal attention with a helpful response, you are presenting your business as a valuable resource.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2574a9;"><strong>How to do it:</strong></span> Do a quick daily search on Twitter for #hashtags and conversations related to your business. Then tweet at these prospects that have used the hashtag with helpful advice and a link to your site or a relevant blog post. You should focus on being resourceful rather than salesy. You don’t want these potential customers to think your spamming them. For a complete guide, check out Hubspot’s <a href="http://offers.hubspot.com/social-prospecting-workbook" target="_blank">Social Prospecting Workbook</a>.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Customer acquisition is all about finding what works best for your target audience. It’s also an area of your business where you should constantly be testing new strategies. Who knows, it might be one of these growth hacks that turn your business into a hit!</p>

What works and what doesn’t? Today, we share 15 examples of CTA buttons to drive conversions &#8230; <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/15-examples-of-cta-buttons-to-drive-conversions-for-online-stores/" rel="nofollow" class="more-link">Read more<span class="meta-nav"></span></a>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year we showed you <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/the-importance-of-call-to-action-buttons-on-your-e-commerce-site/" target="_blank">the importance of call to action (CTA) buttons</a>, emphasizing the significance of placement, size, shape, color and text. What works and what doesn’t? Today, we share 15 examples of CTA buttons to drive conversions for online stores.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18804" title="CTA" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/CTA-1024x537.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="306" /></p>
<p>Using examples from PrestaShop stores, we’ll show you CTA’s that convert with pop-ups, social engagement, home page features and most importantly, product page design. Let’s get started!</p>
<p><span id="more-18802"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">CTA buttons in pop-ups</span></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/using-pop-ups-for-your-online-store-best-practices-and-examples-for-2015/" target="_blank">Pop-ups in online stores</a> can be very effective in drawing a shopper’s attention to a specific CTA. They feature a box or window on top of other page content to increase conversion. See how these shops use pop-ups:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18805" title="01 whatgoesaroundnyc" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/01-whatgoesaroundnyc.png" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.whatgoesaroundnyc.com/ " target="_blank">What Goes Around NYC</a> encourages its customers to sign up for their membership only shop by using this well-timed popup. This pop up only appears after a customer shows interest by clicking on a product &#8211; rather than being displayed immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18806" title="02 teaguys" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/02-teaguys.png" alt="" width="500" height="324" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.teaguys.com/ " target="_blank">Tea Guys</a> approaches pop-ins differently. This pop-up only opens if a customer clicks on the review tab. Once it appears, Tea Guys effectively encourages customers to leave reviews by prominently displaying the “Write a Review” CTA above the fold.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">CTA’s that leverage social trust</span></h2>
<p>To convert visitors into social media followers, these PrestaShop merchants leverage social trust. Social trust stems from the assumption that if lots of people like a company, they must be trustworthy. See how these merchant convert new fans by leveraging their current fan base.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18807" style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24.375px;" title="03 headict.co.uk" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/03-headict.co_.uk_.png" alt="" width="500" height="275" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.headict.co.uk/ " target="_blank">Headict</a> displays social media buttons with a counter displaying the number of fans they currently have. With over 8,000 followers across their three social media platforms, it’s easy to trust this brand and hop on the bandwagon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18808" title="04 29nUnder" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/04-29nUnder.png" alt="" width="500" height="224" /></p>
<p><a href="http://29nunder.com/ " target="_blank">29NUnder</a> not only builds trust with their over 112k followers on Facebook, they make it effortless for you to become a fan. Customers simply need to click the “like” button. No new windows, no sign ups.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">Engaging CTA’s on home pages</span></h2>
<p>Home pages for your online store should draw your audience in and entice them to learn more. These shops encourage visitors to learn more about their products with great images and minimal text.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18809" title="05 adelineaffre" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/05-adelineaffre.png" alt="" width="500" height="329" /></p>
<p><a href="http://adelineaffre.com/en/ " target="_blank">Adelineaffre</a> shows off their products by displaying them in action, or in this case in a home. Seeing how products can be integrated into a customer’s life draws them in and encourages them to learn more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18810" title="06 lindenleaves" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/06-lindenleaves.png" alt="" width="500" height="263" /></p>
<p><a href="http://lindenleaves.com/ " target="_blank">Linden Leaves</a> uses their home page to feature their natural skincare line. They draw attention away from the model and drives the shoppers’ focus to the products by putting the products directly in her line of sight.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">Effective CTA’s on product pages</span></h2>
<p>Although CTA’s are important throughout your website, the most important CTA’s are on your<a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/5-examples-of-ecommerce-product-pages-that-convert/ " target="_blank"> product pages.</a> This call to action is very important because it is the customer’s first step in making a purchase.  With that said, we’re sharing great product page CTA’s and breaking down their copy (text), decoration, location and overall page design.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Great copy</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18811" title="07 bettereverafter" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/07-bettereverafter.png" alt="" width="500" height="277" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bettereverafter.com/112-adventure-in-the-city.html " target="_blank">BetterEverAfter</a>’s product page targets brides building a wedding registry. To highlight this, they use “Add to Registry” rather than “Add to wish list”, making this page perfectly tailored for its target audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18812" title="08 funkylama" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/08-funkylama.png" alt="" width="500" height="301" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.funky-lama.com/en/2247-little-handpuppet-crocodile.html " target="_blank">Funky Lama</a> creates a sense urgency in purchasing their products by including the following message next to the CTA, “Last items in stock!” Want more words that urge customers to purchase? Try “limited time”, “today” or “now”.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Emphasized with borders</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18813" title="09 lafolleadresse" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/09-lafolleadresse.png" alt="" width="589" height="340" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lafolleadresse.com/331-carte-postale-darling-clementine-ooh-la-la-.html " target="_blank">La folle adresse</a> decorates their call to action with a cute icon and a thick dotted border. The decoration is far enough away from the product image so it does not distract, but is highlighted enough to draw your attention towards it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18814" title="10 myindiesoul" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/10-myindiesoul.png" alt="" width="500" height="316" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.myindiesoul.com/boho-bags/356-dunes.html " target="_blank">Indie Soul</a> also highlights their CTA button with a border. However, they matched it to their theme by using only a simple but dark border.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Location, location, location</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18815" title="11 moncolonel.fr" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/11-moncolonel.fr_.png" alt="" width="500" height="368" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.moncolonel.fr/en/table-ware/254-bunol-collection-.html?search_query=bunol&amp;results=1 " target="_blank">Mon Colonel</a> displays their CTA above the fold, making it easy for customers to find. This is especially important for products with lengthy product descriptions. As an added bonus they highlight this button using their web page’s accent color.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18816" title="12 eatingtools" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/12-eatingtools.png" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.eatingtools.com/one-of-a-kind/48-the-osage-scoop.html" target="_blank">Eating Tools</a> places their CTA after the product description, the short description allows it to easily sit above the fold. Aside from the location, this CTA’s size and boldness ensures customers can’t miss it.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overall page design</span></strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18817" title="13 bobbies.fr" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/13-bobbies.fr_.png" alt="" width="500" height="321" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bobbies.fr/en/boots-femme-la-muse/2141204607-boots-fauve-la-muse.html " target="_blank">Bobbies</a> displays their products on a magazine inspired product page and uses their accent color to feature the CTA button. To further highlight it, they grayed out neighboring payment logos. The best thing about this CTA is that although your eyes are drawn to the CTA button, it seamlessly blends in with the overall design of the product page.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18818" title="14 creedboutique" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/14-creedboutique.png" alt="" width="500" height="340" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.creedboutique.com/creed-perfume-for-men/116-creed-aventus-871854009347.html " target="_blank">Creed Boutique</a> also seamlessly integrates their call to action button into their product page. They achieved this without accent colors by simply inverting the CTA button’s colors. The contrast helps shoppers easily spot the button to encourage shopping.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18819" title="15 addons" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/15-addons.png" alt="" width="500" height="309" /></p>
<p>Of course we couldn’t forget the online store for PrestaShop’s official modules and themes, <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/front-office-features-prestashop-modules/2191-box-notification-popup.html " target="_blank">PrestaShop Addons.</a> Our Add to cart button is featured above the fold, making it easily accessible. Additionally, it’s located far from other graphics to ensure it doesn’t detract from product images.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re an online merchant looking to expand your success, look no further than selling internationally. As consumers become more connected, they want the ability to<strong> buy anytime anywhere.</strong> It’s why cross-border transactions (CBT) has become a large opportunity of growth for merchants.</p>
<p>Did you know that cross-border online trade between the 6 largest markets in the world is estimated to be worth over <strong>£1 billion annually </strong>and this figure is predicted to triple by 2018. But before you start localizing your website for every country and language, it’s important to test international markets.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18752" title="ebay-cross-border-trade" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/ebayblog-1024x537.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="306" /> <span id="more-16098"></span></p>
<p>Although testing international markets may sound expensive, we have great news to share. Not only is it affordable, you can even make money while learning about the international demand for the products you sell through your online store.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #e33238;">Cross-border trade through online marketplaces</span></h2>
<p>By leveraging a marketplace, you can easily expand your reach into countless international markets. Marketplaces like eBay gives you access to over 149 million active buyers worldwide. Listing products on eBay’s international marketplace, helps you reach 20% of their buyers who regularly purchase from international sellers – with the remaining 80% saying they’d do so for the right product.</p>
<p>Selling on eBay helps you build a feedback history making it the best first step to cross-border sales. After each sale on eBay, buyers can leave feedback – consisting of a rating and short comment. Based on this feedback, sellers can improve their product descriptions, customer service, shipping options and pricing – to name a few.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0065d1;">Choosing where to sell</span></h2>
<p>Which countries should you target? It depends. Generally, your target market should have a high adoptions rate of online shopping, with limited domestic sellers. However, to determine if your product(s) are right for your selected markets, start by selling through a marketplace. Once you’ve completed sales, you’ll know which counties you should sell to and optimize for.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #85b716;">Getting started with marketplaces</span></h2>
<p>Depending on your shop and the number of products you sell, there are different ways to get started. Smaller businesses with a limited number of products, can start by listing products and offering to ship internationally. When customers browse and search eBay’s catalog, your products will be made available.</p>
<p>Medium-sized businesses with a substantial catalog of products, can open an eBay Shop.* In addition to listing your products for millions of users to purchase, you can create a fully-customized central shopping destination for your products to build your brand. You can also boost sales with marketing tools and list your products for longer at more cost effective prices.</p>
<p>To take advantage of all these features, import your products effortlessly with <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/marketplace-prestashop-modules/2742-ebay.html " target="_blank">eBay’s free module</a>. The eBay module was recently updated to help PrestaShop merchants effortlessly master cross-border trade.</p>
<address>*Please note that only Top Shop and Premium shops (DE), Boutique A la Une and Boutique Premium (FR), Negozio Premium and Negozio Premium Plus (IT) or Tienda Avanzada and Tienda Premium (ES) types of shops on eBay have international selling capabilities.</address>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This story begins one weekend when François Gaillard, a PrestaShop developer, decided to spend 48 hours developing on a program that will automatically detect development errors in a module. After countless hours of coding, he created the PrestaShop Automatic Module Validator.</p>
<p>Version 1 (V1) saw the light of day in November 2013, when community module developers started using the tool. After successfully launching this tool, François released V2 in February, complete with new features and help pages.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18744" title="validator2" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/validator2-1024x537.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="306" /></p>
<p><span id="more-18743"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Today we are proud to make two announcements: first, we&#8217;ve reached the milestone of <span style="color: #76bd43; font-weight: bold;">30,000 validations! </span> Second: you can now <span style="color: #76bd43; font-weight: bold;">track your module’s progress</span> through a graph.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #ed2279; font-weight: bold;">- Errors and warnings:</span> If the validator detects anomalies during the validation, it will provide you a report listing errors and warnings it detected, making it really easy for you to correct them.<br />
<span style="color: #ed2279; font-weight: bold;">- Validation via GitHub repository:</span> Validate your module directly from GitHub by specifying the repository, regardless it is public or private.<br />
<span style="color: #ed2279; font-weight: bold;">- Module generator:</span> No need to start from scratch. Enter in some information about the module you want to create, then you can download a modified .zip file already adapted to the structure and norms of PrestaShop modules!<br />
<span style="color: #ed2279; font-weight: bold;">- Search for classes, methods, and features:</span> Do you want to know what version(s) a class is used in, and what file you can find it in? Find out with the search engine designed just for this!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18745" title="insight" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/insight-1024x537.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="306" /></p>
<p><a href="https://validator.prestashop.com/" target="_blank">The validator</a>’s mission is to help you, PrestaShop Module developers, submit high-quality modules for merchants. With this module, you will increase compatibility during migrations, reduce support requests, and simplify updates.</p>
<p>So go for it: it&#8217;s as simple as loading a module and waiting a few seconds for the tool to do its job. It&#8217;s a huge time saver for every developer &#8211; use it as often as you’d like!</p>
<p>Above all, feel free to send François an <a href="mailto:validator@prestashop.com" target="_blank">email</a> with your suggestions for improvement. Or find him on <a href="https://github.com/gaillafr" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gaillafr" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to stay up to date with his projects!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we tackle a controversial topic: pop-ups. They have earned themselves a bad reputation as many find them annoying and intrusive. However, they are staging a revival through many popular websites.</p>
<p>But do pop-ups really work? Today, we will demonstrate their effectiveness and show you how to use them wisely. That way you can avoid using ill-timed pop-up windows despised by web surfers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18714" title="popup5" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/popup5-1024x537.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="306" /></p>
<p><span id="more-18654"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #64a101;">So, what exactly are pop-ups?</span></h2>
<p>There are actually several different types of pop-up, but they all have one goal: to feature a box or a window in the foreground, on top of the page content. In other words, they cover content to highlight other information. We generally make the following distinction between &#8216;pop-ups&#8217; and &#8216;pop-ins&#8217;:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pop-up</span> automatically opens a new browser window in front of the main browser without any action from the user.<br />
A<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> pop-in</span> is similar to a pop-up in that it displays content in front of the webpage visited. However, a pop-in opens up a box within the page rather than a new window.</p>
<p>While there are lots of different names for these interfaces, &#8216;pop-up&#8217; is the most widely used, and will be the term used throughout this article. Therefore, the term &#8216;pop-up&#8217; is used to refer to a &#8216;pop-in&#8217;, i.e. a box that opens within the page and not an new window.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #0232a0;">How are pop-ups used on ecommerce websites?</span></h4>
<p>They are generally used to conduct surveys, encourage newsletter subscriptions, increase fans on social media and promote special offers.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #64a101;">Public enemy number one or conversion rate hero?</span></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #0232a0;"><strong>Pop-up Advantages:</strong></span></h4>
<p>Any action suggested in a pop-up carries a higher conversion rate than when it is simply published on the website. It is undeniable that this approach, which forces users to look, does a better job at attracting visitor attention.</p>
<p>KISSmetrics published some interesting case studies on the effect of pop-ups in their article entitled <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/three-risky-ecommerce-techniques/" target="_blank">Three Risky Ecommerce Techniques That Could Actually Increase Your Conversions. </a></p>
<p>A particularly interesting case involves Darren Rowse, a writer for ProBlogger. He grew his newsletter signup rate by <strong>900</strong>% by simply adding a pop-up. Another blogger also echoes his result by sharing, her subscription rate grew <strong>1,375% </strong>after inserting a pop-up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #333333;"><strong>Advantages</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong></strong>- Attract visitor attention<br />
- Quickly increase your conversion rate</p>
<h4><span style="color: #0232a0;"><strong>Pop-ups: A double-edged sword</strong></span></h4>
<p>We have just seen how pop-ups can be substantially beneficial. However, we cannot ignore the fact that web surfers have now developed a reflex for automatically closing them. That is why it is important to carefully consider the message they contain. Furthermore, anyone who wants to install pop-ups on their website should be aware of the risks associated with their misuse.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #333333;"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong></strong>- Very intrusive as they are automatically displayed<br />
- Require an action on the part of the user<br />
- Bad reputation due to countless lackluster advertisements<br />
- Misuse may irritate users and reflect negatively to your store</p>
<h2><span style="color: #64a101;">Summary of an effective pop-up</span></h2>
<p>To help you create effective pop-ups we’re sharing best practices broken down into Dos and Don’ts. This way, you can avoid the problems we mentioned above.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0232a0;">Dos</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• Use a <a href="http://digitalmarketing-glossary.com/What-is-Lightbox-definition " target="_blank">lightbox </a>pop-up.<br />
• Make it easy to close the pop-up with a clearly visible cross or by simply clicking outside the pop-up window.<br />
• Use a tracking cookie so that the pop-up isn&#8217;t displayed every time a user visits your website.<br />
• Set the pop-up to appear after one minute or two page views. Setting parameters such as these lets the visitor gain a better understanding of your website before being asked to perform an action.<br />
• Pop-up content and copy should focus on user benefits. Pay attention to the title to encourage users to act. For instance, you could mention the number of people already subscribed to the newsletter, or offer a discount for signing up.<br />
• Try out different designs and elements to find the best format for you.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0232a0;">Don&#8217;ts</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• Don&#8217;t display pop-ups too often; otherwise you may be indexed as spam.<br />
• Don&#8217;t ask for too much information: a name and email address should be sufficient for newsletter sign-up.<br />
• Don&#8217;t use pop-ups that appear when a user wants to leave a page; otherwise they may leave for good.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #64a101;">Some pop-up inspiration</span></h2>
<p>For some inspiration, here are PrestaShop stores currently using pop-ups.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #b9086b;"><strong>We love</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• The €10 off for signing up for the newsletter<br />

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #b9086b;"><strong>We love</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• The clearly visible “x” for closing the pop-up<br />
• That the pop-up appears only after three clicks</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.americanvintage-store.com/en/" target="_blank">American Vintage</a><br />
<a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/pop-in-4.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18658" title="pop in 4" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/pop-in-4.png" alt="" width="587" height="304" /></a></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #b9086b;"><strong>We love</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• That the pop-up closes by clicking outside the window<br />
• The customer benefits are clearly stated</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customer complaints are not fun nor are they easy to deal with. However, when handled correctly, these complaints can help you build customer loyalty and improve your business overall.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18682" title="Customer-Complaints-colorlign" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/Customer-Complaints-colorlign-1024x537.png" alt="" width="584" height="306" /><br />
To help you become a master at handling customer complaints, we’ve interviewed Karina Ludz from <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/administration-tools-prestashop-modules/17727-yousticeresolutionsystem.htmlhttp:/addons.prestashop.com/en/youstice" target="_blank">Youstice</a>, a global platform for resolving customer disputes. She shares the 3 must-follow rules for addressing your online store’s customer complaints.</p>
<p><span id="more-18681"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #9f5c9f;">Rule 1: Treat customer personally &#8211; not like another “case number”</span></h4>
<p>Listen to customers and always approach them personally rather than “selling” them the same, well-rehearsed answer or solution. Don’t be afraid of negative criticism and pay attention to every piece of feedback &#8211; it can show you any shortcomings in your company and product(s).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #761775; text-decoration: underline;"><em>Results</em></span></span>:<br />
Proactively listening to customer feedback will help you improve both your product and customer service by eliminating any factors that can stifle your success. Remember – no matter how great your customer care is, there is always room for improvement.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #761775; text-decoration: underline;"><em>Why it is essential:</em></span></span><br />
Customer demands and needs are shifting quicker than ever. By treating customers like just another “case number” you risk not properly addressing customer complaints, especially in today’s ever-changing market.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #761775; text-decoration: underline;"><em>Example</em></span>:</span><br />
<strong>Customer</strong>: I received the wrong item, and I love it! But I also want my original item.<br />
<strong>Merchant</strong>: We’re happy to hear that you love the item! Although we normally ask customers to return the wrong item, we’d gladly bill you for it and ship out your original item. For our shipping error, we’d gladly expedite your shipping at no charge.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #9f5c9f;">Rule 2: Don’t let the issue to escalate – offer a win-win solution</span></h4>
<p>Dealing with customers complaints is not a battle with only one winner. Provide a solution that benefits both your company and the customer by creating a win-win situation. Do your best to avoid having the issue escalate into negative reviews about your company.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #761775; text-decoration: underline;">Results:</span></em></span><br />
A win-win solution shows customers that you can address their concerns. Solving customer issues quickly and professionally builds customer loyalty, ensuring that they will continue to shop with you – rather than your competitors.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #761775; text-decoration: underline;">Why it is essential:</span></em></span><br />
Issues that escalate can damage your shop’s reputation. In today’s competitive marketplace, it is easier than ever for customers to switch from one shop to another. Avoid chasing customers away with poor customer service.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #761775; text-decoration: underline;">Example:</span></em></span><br />
<strong>Customer</strong>: The product did not arrive on time, as stated by the tracking information!<br />
<strong>Merchant</strong>: We’re sorry to hear that the package did not arrive on time. Unfortunately, after the package leaves the warehouse, we have no control over the delivery. We can call our carrier for more information about your package and provide you with an update.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #9f5c9f;">Rule 3: Focus on facts, not emotions</span></h4>
<p>Don’t let emotions get in the way. Stay professional and to-the-point when dealing with disgruntled customers. To earn your customer’s love – and respect, stick to facts and offer tangible solutions. Additionally, be transparent and honest. Don’t hide facts about your offer nor over promise. At the end of the day, honestly is always the best policy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #761775; text-decoration: underline;"><em>Results</em></span>:</span><br />
Sticking to the facts will help you get to the root of the customer complaint. Understandingly exactly why they are upset will help you arrive at a customer resolution quicker and more efficiently. It’s the perfect way to provide timely and professional customer service.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #761775;"><em>Why it is essential:</em></span></span><br />
Emotions can easily escalate an issue from simple to complicated very quickly. You risk having existing customers share their emotionally-fueled, negative experience with their peers. This can adversely affect you company, costing you existing and potential customers.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #761775;"><em>Example:</em></span></span><br />
<strong>Customer</strong>: I’m frustrated because I tried to place an order 3 times, and I cannot reach customer service.<br />
<strong>Merchant</strong>: Walk me through your process for placing an order. If we encounter the same error, I can take your order over the phone. Additionally, can you tell me how you tried reaching us? I’d like to ensure that we address any future questions in a timely manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18685" title="Youstice_logo_horiz_white" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/Youstice_logo_horiz_white.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="102" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In part 1 of this series, titled ‘<a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/find-the-right-seo-keywords-for-your-online-store/" target="_blank">How to find the right SEO keywords for your online store</a>’, we showed you a simple method for finding the best keywords for your online store. Now that you have your keywords, we are going to look at one of my favorite subjects: how to structure a website for optimal SEO.</p>
<p>Website structure for ecommerce sites centers on category organization, but you need to also consider the user experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18614" title="SEO-21-1024x307" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/SEO-21-1024x307.png" alt="" width="536" height="160" /></p>
<p><span id="more-18612"></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>To create and improve your website structure, I recommend using these tools:</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>• A spreadsheet, such as an Excel document, where you can play around with your keywords.<br />
• An Open Source mind mapping tool called <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download" target="_blank">FreeMind </a>that is free and compatible with all operating systems.</p>
<p>In this article, I&#8217;m using the example of keywords related to<em> T-shirts</em>.<br />
I have identified almost 50 keywords–a mix of British and American English–and collected data on search volumes using Google AdWords Keyword Tool.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">How many keywords should I have?</span></h2>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule for this; it depends on you and your online store. A simple website with a limited number of pages will have only a few keywords, while a larger one will have more, and so on and so forth.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">What is search volume?</span></h2>
<p>According to Google, search volume corresponds to the average monthly number of searches made for a particular keyword (entered into Google only) over the past 12 months, for the given language and location.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">Let&#8217;s take a closer look at keywords</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first thing we notice is that all keywords are not created equal in terms of search volume. Generally speaking, the higher the keyword search volume, the more competition there will be, making it more difficult for you to appear on the first page of Google search results.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Here&#8217;s an example of the long tail for keywords related to &#8216;T-Shirt&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18615" title="SEO2 IMG1" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/SEO2-IMG1.png" alt="" width="565" height="372" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">Different ways of saying the same thing</span></h2>
<p>When it comes to organic searches, we often say that the user is always right. It is clear that users searching for the same thing may do so in a number of different ways. For example:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-18616 alignnone" title="SEO2 IMG2" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/SEO2-IMG2.png" alt="" width="218" height="233" /></p>
<p>However, this does not mean you should create a product category for each spelling variant of a search. Rather, you should group together the keywords, based on the searches carried out by users, to produce categories based on its variants:</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Similar keywords are combined to form category groups for my online store.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-18617 aligncenter" title="SEO2 IMG3" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/SEO2-IMG3.png" alt="" width="468" height="233" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">Let&#8217;s structure this for an SEO-FRIENDLY ecommerce website</span></h2>
<p>Once you have grouped your keywords and created categories for your store, launch your FreeMind mind mapping tool:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Suggested category organization Version 1.0</strong></span><br />
<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18618" title="SEO2 IMG4" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/SEO2-IMG4.png" alt="" width="510" height="451" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">When SEO and ergonomics are combined</span></h2>
<p>For optimal category organization, I created two new categories that have nothing to do with SEO but will help organize the store and make it more user friendly:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• Styles<br />
• Brands</p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">Testing your structure</span></h2>
<p>Once you have created your mind map, consider how each path (listed below) will affect the user navigation as well as the filters available on your website. Use this checklist to test your structure:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Top-down navigation:</strong></span><br />
From the homepage, I reach the category pages to find any T-shirt I may be interested in.<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bottom-up navigation:</strong></span><br />
I can start browsing through any category and will be able to work my way back up the trail in a way that seems logical. (The &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation)" target="_blank">Breadcrumb trail</a>&#8216; is generally used to achieve this.)<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Combining filters:</strong></span><br />
Do I have enough categories to satisfy my shoppers&#8217; needs? Could I, for example, combine the [style] and [gender] filters?</p>
<p>Looking back at my first mind map, I realized that users cannot access pages like &#8216;Geek T-shirts for Men&#8217; or &#8216;Cool T-shirts for Women&#8217;.<br />
With this in mind, I updated my mind map to include new categories, to benefits both users and SEO.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Suggested category organization Version 2.0</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18619" title="SEO2 IMG5" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/10/SEO2-IMG5.png" alt="" width="659" height="621" /><br />
<em>For clarity, I showed only the combination of [style] and [gender] categories here, but of course you can combine [brands] or [colors], etc., to create even more pages.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em></em><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Lateral thinking:</strong></span><br />
Imagine that a visitor arrives on your website through Google after searching for &#8216;Cool T-shirts&#8217;, and wants to filter the results by [gender]. Situations like this highlights the importance of having a navigational structure that guides users toward similar pages or other pages of interest. In the diagram above, arrows are used to represent lateral navigation.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">Don&#8217;t forget to prioritize users over SEO</span></h2>
<p>Remember that Google isn’t the one buying products from your store, but rather the shoppers searching for your products. So, always prioritize users over search engine optimization. The idea is to find a compromise between being SEO-friendly and user-friendly.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #009bdf;">Integrating categories into your PrestaShop store</span></h2>
<p>When you think you have the right structure, get to work integrating these categories into your PrestaShop store!<br />
